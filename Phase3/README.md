# Heap and Binomial Heap Implementation

This is an implementation of Heap and Binomial Heap data structures, which provide efficient ways to store and manipulate collections of elements with dynamic size.

## Try it yourself

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/danetsao/CS201-Data-Structures-Library"
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Phase3
```

Run the makefile

```bash
  make
```

Execute

```bash
  ./Phase3
```

Feel free to mess around with the Phase3Main.cpp to create different trees and test different cases.
