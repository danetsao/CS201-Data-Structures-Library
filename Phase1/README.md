# Circular Dynamic Array Implementation

This is an implementation of a circular dynamic array data structure, which provides an efficient way to store and manipulate a collection of elements with dynamic size while maintaining circular indexing for constant-time access to elements.

## Try it yourself

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/danetsao/CS201-Data-Structures-Library"
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Phase2
```

Run the makefile

```bash
  make
```

Execute

```bash
  ./Phase2
```

Feel free to mess around with the Phase2Main.cpp to create different trees and test different cases.
