# Red Black Tree Implementation

This is an implementation of a Red Black Tree, which provides an efficient way to maintain a sorted collection of elements while ensuring balanced tree structure and fast operations.

## Try it yourself

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/danetsao/CS201-Data-Structures-Library"
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Phase2
```

Run the makefile

```bash
  make
```

Execute

```bash
  ./Phase2
```

Feel free to mess around with the Phase2Main.cpp to create different trees and test different cases.
